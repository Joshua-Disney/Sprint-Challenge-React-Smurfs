1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
      Server-side routing is where all changes happen on the server.  Whenever a change in route happens, the request goes out to the server and the server sends in an entire new HTML file to be rendered to the screen.  With client-side routing, all changes are handled internally by manipulating the state and rendering the new state.

2.  What does HTTP stand for?
      HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.  It is the protocol over how information is sent between an application and the browser.

3.  What does CRUD stand for?
      CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete.  They are the functions by which we alter the databases we're working with.  For example, in this project, to add a new Smurf to the array.

4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
      Post can be mapped to Create, get can be mapped to Read, put can be mapped to Update, and delete can, of course, be mapped to Delete.

5.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests
      Fetch API, Axios, and jQuery can be used to make AJAX requests.
